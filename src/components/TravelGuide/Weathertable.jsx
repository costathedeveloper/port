        <p className='my-4'>Cape Town has a pleasantly warm and temperate Mediterranean-style climate. There are seasonal differences throughout the year; sometimes the city serves four seasons in one day.

Temperatures can reach up to 35°C during summer, making it an ideal time for beach lovers.

At the same time, the autumn and spring seasons provide visitors with the right conditions to explore the scenic beauty of nature around Cape Town.

Winter brings the rains to South Africa. So, it leads to more time indoors, enjoying meals or drinks close to a fireplace.</p>
